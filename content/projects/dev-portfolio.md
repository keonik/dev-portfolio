You're looking at it! I wanted a place to showcase my writing and have some fun learning a new technology. Being a React fan, I tried out [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [TailwindCSS](http://tailwindcss.com/). They both have been fun to work with and easy to maintain thanks to the admin dashboard provided by [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). All blog posts are written using markdown!
