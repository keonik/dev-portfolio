A friend of mine, <a href="https://heystevegray.dev">Steve Gray</a> said "I wish
there was an app that could just randomly pick what I was going to eat today.
I eat the same five places and just don't want to choose anymore". Well now he
uses this. We had some fun building one of our first PWA's together here. It
keeps whatever list you desire to be served to you random. My wife and I used
to use it to see who's turn it was to walk the dogs ðŸ˜‚
