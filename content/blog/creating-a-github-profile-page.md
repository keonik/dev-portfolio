## Why

Github recently added a new feature to allow users to create a profile page when visiting.

Having a Github readme is a great way to show viewers what you have going on at a quick glance. Not everyone has the time to create a developer site but we all can make time to create a profile readme

## Existing examples

For an up to date curation visit [awesome-github-profile-readme](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme) to view examples for some inspiration.

I personally enjoy the integrations on [Thomas Guibert's](https://github.com/thmsgbrt) profile with his actions to list his most recent blog posts

## How

### 1. Create a new repo

Make sure it's the same name as your GitHub username. While you're creating that you should see this

![Create your repository](/img/creating_readme.png)

As long as the repository name matches your username you should see this secret message.

### 2. Ensure you check the following option

### 4. Visit `github.com/your_username/your_username` to view the default read me profile made
